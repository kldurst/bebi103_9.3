Extra Credit Problem 9.3 for Caltech Course: Be/Bi 103

Analysis of data presented as part of the Gardner, Zanic, et al. paper titled: 
"Depolymerizing Kinesins Kip3 and MCAK Shape Cellular Microtubule Architecture by Differential Control of Catastrophe" 
(link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411012876?via%3Dihub).

Here's our work for 9.3. This was done based on the microtubule catastrophe analysis problem 9.1 (and the previous problems).

The names of the notebook layout the steps of the process taken for data analysis, in a (hopefully) logical order.

There are still many things I would like to change about this, to make the code and writeups more clear, but there's
only so much time in the day!
